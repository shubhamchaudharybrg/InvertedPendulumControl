# This file has functions to simulate 3 scenarios in socket connection:
# 1) Jitter 
# 2) Latency
# 3) Packet Loss

import time 

# Function to introduce latency
def latency(ltncy): # in seconds
    time.sleep(ltncy)

# Function to introduce pakcket loss
def packetLoss():
    a

# Function to introduce jitter
def jitter():
